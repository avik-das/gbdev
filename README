== GB DEVELOPMENT - Avik Das ===========================================

A collection of programs written for the Nintendo Game Boy (GB). The
Game Boy Color may also be targetted in the future, though the current
state of the project targets only the original Game Boy. Due to the
limitations of the hardware, all the programs must be relatively small,
so it makes sense to keep them all in the same repository.

The included programs are described briefly below, while more elaborate
descriptions are provided inside the corresponding directories.

~~ PREREQUISITES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The programs are written in the appropriate variant of Z80 assembly,
using the RGBDS Assembler and Linker. The version of the toolkit used
for these programs may be found at https://github.com/bentley/rgbds .
The Makefiles assume that the toolkit is on the PATH.

To run the programs after assembly, a GB emulator is required. The
programs are tested on VisualBoy Advance and mednafen, which are
available at http://vba.ngemu.com/ and http://mednafen.sourceforge.net/
respectively.

The programs are written in vim, and a modeline is present in the source
files that gives them the appropriate syntax highlighting. The syntax
file is available on the vim scripts website as rgbasm.vim
(https://github.com/vim-scripts/rgbasm.vim).

~~ INCLUDED PROGRAMS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More detailed descriptions are available in the README files inside the
directory containing each program.

sprite - A simple test program that demonstrates a wide variety of
  hardware-provided functionality and general programming techniques.
