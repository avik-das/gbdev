== MONEY RUN - Avik Das ===============================================

A simple side-scroller, in which the character is asked to go from left
to right, navigating over a series procedurally generated columns.

The name refers to the gameplay mechanic in which the player will be
trying to collect money while avoiding getting stuck amongst the
columns. This has not been implemented yet. See my HTML5 implementation
of this game [1] to see what the completed game is supposed to look
like.

~~ RUNNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assemble and run money-run using an emulator like VBA-M:

  make
  vbam money-run.gb

The following buttons are utilized:

   START : start the game
