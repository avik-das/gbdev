        MONEY-RUN is a simple side-scroller, in which the character is asked to go from left to right, navigating over a series procedurally generated columns.

        The name refers to the gameplay mechanic in which the player will be trying to collect money while avoiding getting stuck amongst the columns. This has not been implemented yet. See my <a href="https://github.com/avik-das/games-practice/tree/master/01-money-run">HTML5 implementation of this game</a> to see what the completed game is supposed to look like.
