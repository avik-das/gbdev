== LCDC STATUS INTERRUPT - Avik Das ====================================

A program to demonstrate the use of the LCDC Status interrupt in order
to achieve some graphical effects that would otherwise be difficult or
impossible using the video system in the Game Boy.

~~ RUNNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assemble and run stat-interrupt using an emulator like VBA-M:

  make
  vbam stat-interrupt.gb

This program takes no user input.

~~ FUNCTIONALITY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each line of the background is scrolled in a sinusoidal pattern, in
order to display a curved pattern using only a single tile and a sine
lookup table. This is achieved by using to the LCDC Status interrupt to
modify the SCX and SCY registers (which scroll the background) a varying
amount each scanline.

Additionally, there is a window layer, but instead of overlaying a
contiguous region of the screen, the LYC Coincidence Flag is used to
hide the window after the top of the window has been rendered, then show
it again at the bottom of the screen.

~~ FURTHER READING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LCDC Status register and its corresponding interrupts are detailed
in the Pan Docs, the canonical Game Boy development resource. A version
is available via a link from Emudocs (http://emu-docs.org).
